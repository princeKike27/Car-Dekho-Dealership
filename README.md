# Prediction of Car's Selling Price in CarDekho Dealership

For this project I analyzed data from CarDekho dealership. CarDekho  is IndiaÂ´s leading car search venture, it has tie-ups with many auto manufacturers, car dealers and financial insitutions to facilitate the purchase of vehicles for its customers. In that sense, I created a Multiple Linear Regression Model that predicts a car's selling price based on features like model year, kilometers driven, type of fuel, type of owner and brand. 

Throughout the project you will be able to find:

- Data cleaning and standardization.
- Analysis of Relevant features to build the model. 
- Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict a car's selling price.
